	Curly brackets <i>{}</i> should be placed on a seperate line. 
	This means that after <b>ANY</b> statement (if, for, while etc) a newline should
	be added containing the curly bracket. <br />
	The reason for doing is, is that missing curly brackets could be more easily detected,
	because they <b>ALWAYS</b> got the same amount of tabs before the curly bracket.
	A programmer should look vertical to see if an opening curly bracket meets a vertical
	curly bracket and vice versa.
	<br /> <br /> <br />

	Let me explain the missing curly bracket by looking vertical in the code. <br />
	If we look at the correct way of writing the curly bracket on the next line
	(see the code on the right), we can see that both curly brackets contains 1 tab space	
	before the actual curly bracket is written. They are in line with each other. <br />
	If we would write a bigger statement and write the curly bracket on the same line, the curly bracket
	may not be even onto the screen. This causes that the programmer need to scroll to look at the last
	character of the statement and verify if this is a curly bracket or not. 
	<br /> <br />

	Writing the curly bracket on a new line in line with the other (the same amount of tabs) it is way easier
	to find out if there is a mission curly bracket or not.

	A struct and a union may be typedeffed, but this is not recommended.
	If you typedef a struct or a union, you are actually hiding some important
	information for other programmers. It is legal to use,
	but do not typedef if you are wisely.<br />

	Struct and union members should be written in snake_case, since they are not constants.
	Writing them in another style, like CamelCase is strictly forbidden and is <b>not allowed</b>.
	<br /> <br /> <br />					


	As you can see in the code, the curly brackets are on new lines as discussed before.
	Keep in mind that structs and unions should be declared as much as possible in an header
	file (.h extension). More on this later.

	Enums are a slightly bit different than structs and unions.
	Since enums are integers that start from 0, they can be seen
	as constants. Constants in this sentence means that enum elements
	should be all capitaliezd. <br />

	After each enum element there should be a comma next to the last character
	of the enum element. <b>NO</b> spaces are allowed.
	<br /> <br />

	If needed, you may change the default value of an element by using the 
	assign operator followed by a space and the value. The rule is the same,
	the comma is placed after the last number and no spaces are between
	the comma and the last digit.

	Conditions are used in an if-, while-, for-, and switch statement.
	If a programmer want to compare a value that may not be equal to 0,
	the programmer should not write != 0. Any statement is true if the value
	is not equal to 0. The progammer should only write his value inside the statement.
	<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

	If a programmer want to verify that a variable is equal to 0, he should not write
	== 0. Instead we use the logic NOT operator. Statements are true if a variable is not
	equal to zero. If we add the logic NOT operator (!) a statement would run true if
	the value is equal to zero.
	<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

	It is important to improve the readability of the source code for other
	human programmers. To comply with this, the space bar is important in 
	conditional statements. <br />
	A space should be added between a variable and an operator (and vice versa).

	It's standard to define preprocessor constant with all capital letters.
	To seperate 2 words from eachother, use an underscore _. <br />
	Macro names should be all capitalized, since they are made with the #define
	keyword of the preprocessor. <br />
	I have been thinking if the definition of the macro arguments should be
	capatilized aswell, but could not give a valid reason why it may not. 
	<br /> <br />

	since <a href = "https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macro-Arguments.html"> GNU </a>
	uses capitalized letters for macro names it is the best to follow this.
	I know that GNU does define its macro's with small letters, and I do not agree with them
	on this point. Please use capitalized letters on #defines all the time.
	<br /> <br />
	
	Do not forget alignment. After the #define keyword should be a tab, which uses only 1 space
	since a tab is 4 spaces and #define is 7 characters. Next, write your constant or macro name
	followed by a tab or two so the definition is aligned with each other.
